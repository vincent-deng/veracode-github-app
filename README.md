# veracode-github-app

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) A Probot app

## Building and Running the App

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t veracode-github-app .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> veracode-github-app
```

## Debugging Locally via VS Code

The following explains how to debug locally on MacOS or in Windows WSL2.

### Prerequisites

- Install the following:
  - VS Code ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
  - Docker Desktop ([link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install))
  - ngrok ([link](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup)) - note you will need to create an account
- Create the `veracode-github-app` in a GitHub organization:
  - You must have a GitHub account to install the Veracode GitHub App into that contains at least one Maven or Gradle based Java repository that compiles successfully and produces a `.jar`, `.war` or `.ear` file. You can use [jtsmith2020/verademo-java](https://github.com/jtsmith2020/verademo-java) if you do not already have a Java application to test against.
  - Make sure you can build and run the `veracode-github-app` using the steps in [Building and Running the App](#building-and-running-the-app).
  - Once the `veracode-github-app` is running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  - If this is the first time you have run the app, you should see a **Getting Started** page. Follow the steps documented in the Probot [Configuring a GitHub App](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) documentation to install the app into the default Organization associated with your GitHub account.
  - Setup the necessary GitHub actions to trigger workflows that scan your Java application:
    - Fork the [vincentdeng-veracode/veracode](https://github.com/vincentdeng-veracode/veracode) repo into your GitHub Organization.
    - In your forked `veracode` repository, navigate to **_Actions_** and make sure that actions are enabled for this repository.
    - Next, navigate to **_Settings/Secrets and Variables/Actions_** and set the following three Repository secrets:
      - `API_ID`: A Veracode API ID associated with an account that can perform Static scans.
      - `API_KEY`: A Veracode API Secret Key associated with an account that can perform Static scans.
      - `SRCCLR_API_TOKEN`: A Veracode SCA Agent token associated with the SCA Workspace you wish to perform scans against.

### Debug Setup Steps

1. From a terminal, enter the following to start an ngrok local tunnel:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

2. Look for the **Forwarding** public ngrok URL in the output of the above command (this should be something like [https://abc0-123-456-78-910.ngrok.io](https://abc0-123-456-78-910.ngrok.io). Copy this URL into the `ngrok` constant in [src/utils/constants.js](https://github.com/vincent-deng/veracode-github-app/blob/a61fb3b58083a4df7a307a6d04c6199591a1dd9b/src/utils/constants.js#L3).
3. Start DynamoDB locally using the following commands:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory -sharedDb
  DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000 dynamodb-admin
  ```

4. Navigate to the DynamoDB console at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) and add select **_Create Table_** to add a scan state table with the following settings and select **_Submit_**:
   - **Table Name:** `veracode-github-app`
   - **Hash Attribute Name:** `run_id`
   - **Hash Attribute Type:** Number
5. In your [GitHub Developer App Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps), select the veracode-github-app you installed in the prerequisites and make sure that the following entries match your local configuration values:
   - **App ID:** number listed on this page matches the `APP_ID` value in your local `.env` file.
   - **Webhook URL:** matches the `ngrok` forwarding URL in [/src/utils/constants.js](https://github.com/vincent-deng/veracode-github-app/blob/aws-ecs-dynamodb/src/utils/constants.js).
6. Select **_Run and Debug > Launch Probot_** to start a debug session for the Probot app. Some useful first breakpoints are on the webhook routes located in [/src/index.js](https://github.com/vincent-deng/veracode-github-app/blob/main/src/index.js).
7. Clone your Maven or Gradle based Java repository and start to make some changes to see everything working. The basic development flow you should follow is:

   1. Create a new branch for your Java project.
   2. Make some changes in the branch, commit and push them.
   3. In GitHub, create a PR for the changes, you should find that breakpoints are triggered as the webhook associated with the GitHub events are fired.
   4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 over and over.

### Debugging Hints

- Set breakpoints at the entry points for the webhooks that are triggered on veracode-github-app. These are located in [/src/index.js](https://github.com/vincent-deng/veracode-github-app/blob/main/src/index.js). Specifically, you should look at adding these against the `push`, `workflow_run.completed` and `register` hooks.
